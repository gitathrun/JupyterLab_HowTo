# JupyterLab_HowTo
## Author: Teng Fu

This is a repository for JupyterLab related knowledge.
The aim of this repository includes:
- Introducing JupyterLab
- Tricks for JupyterLab usage

JupyterLab is a new generation of Jupyter toolkit, we can consider it as a integration and advancement of current Jupyter tools which includes:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter console (not QTConsole)

Along with other useful programming tools such as:
- Local Terminal (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- Text Editor
- Directory (IDE style)

In my previous experience of Jupyter notebook usage, I always suffers from change the focus between different Windows, alt+tab to find log monitoring terminal, alt+tab to test a snippet of code in another console to see if it works, alt+tab to check whether model persistance file is generated, etc.

Unless you had a very clear mind where are looking for, otherwise, you will easily lost in the forrest of windows/tabs......

That is something I am not quick happy about, but it is also a painful story to jump back to IDEs, where Jupyter Notebook is becoming part of my development habit.

Jupyter developers feels that pain and bring in the JupyterLab, a tool that is not an IDE but has most IDE features, also, it is not a typical Notebook, but notebook is a part of it.
